# figure out what is model scales, is it bbox?

# what is target * target pose? pose in next frame? looks more like in current frame
# need to create model scales for each image pose (if put the tool in a way that its
# always in camera, then still need to find a way to have model scale)
# need to relate model scale with our item image in "multiple frames"
# need to have depth and mask for each item in each frame, and properly linked
# figure out what is choose and what is cloud
# need to have a mesh file instead of sphere.xyz
